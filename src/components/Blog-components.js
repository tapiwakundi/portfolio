export const header1 = "Current Issues"
export const para1 = "In the article “How CEOs Can Lead a Data-Driven Culture” by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal, readers gain insight on the significance of a data-driven culture in an increasingly competitive global market. Davenport and Mittal discuss the various research done on data cultures in companies and more with a closer look at how CEOs and management perceive data as well as their self-efficacy, specifically, in using and interpreting data. Surprisingly most do not feel they are using data effectively and because this is common across the globe, the intent of the article is to propose solutions to this seemingly daunting problem."
export const para2 = "Before solutions can be implemented, a key thing to note is how paramount the CEO’s role is in leading and cultivating change in an organization. I agree with the article that CEOs must be able to analyze and interpret data to make sound decisions. This alone sets the tone for how the organization operates and specifically how the decision-making process should be conducted. Not only does it send an incredibly powerful message to other executives, but will reverberate throughout the whole organization. With this in mind, there are three strategies that firms can begin considering in relation to their goals."
export const header2 = "Deriving Solutions"
export const subheader1 = "Leading by Example"
export const para3 = "Although the article, ranks educational programs as the most important solution, it can be argued that leading by example is more imperative to facilitate real and meaningful change. It is no secret that great leaders lead by example and it is continuously reinforced especially when we look at great historic leaders such as Nelson Mandela or Henry Ford. When leaders choose to lead in such a manner, it exhibits a great deal of integrity which enables them to inspire and influence those around them. Likewise, in organizations, CEOs who demonstrate integrity by using data to make sound business decisions will have the opportunity to orchestrate and exhibit a data-driven culture in their organizations"
export const para4 = "This article has a great real-life application that suggests leaders frequently asking, “Do you have data to support your point?” This is an incredibly simple but powerful question that instills a mindset in the organization of, “Which data can I access, organize and interpret to support my idea?” When members of an organization commence thinking in this fashion, the whole organization will experience a paradigm shift towards a data-driven culture."
export const subheader2 ="Educational Programs"
export const para5 = "The secondary solution is the implementation of educational programs in firms that don’t identify as being data-driven. Intuitively, it makes sense. Leaders in firms might simply be unaware of how to use the data they collect. Evidently, this can lead to management that is reluctant to use such data and ultimately inhibits growth in firms. In fact, when 1300 senior executives were interviewed, 81% agreed that data skills are critical and should be a requirement to hold senior roles in a company while an astounding 67% admitted to being uncomfortable accessing and using data. This discrepancy must be addressed, and a great way to start is introducing programs that help management and executives acquire the necessary skills that they already believe they should have."
export const para6 = "A fantastic example outlined in this article is the initiative taken by TD Bank Group. They implemented a day-long program called “Data and Analytics Academy for the Non-Analytics Executive.” In this program, executives are immersed in simulations, a customized case study as well as various exercises. This program develops the foundation of data analytics as well as the thought process that goes with such a novel field in business. It is quite clear that firms are quickly adapting to the era of data analytics to build an erudite workforce in order to gain competitive advantages in their respective industries."
export const subheader3 = "promotion and Rewards"
export const para7 = "The final solution outlined in the article is promotions and rewards. I agree that this can certainly go a long way in encouraging change in an organization but excellent coordination with Human Resources (HR) is required for this to materialize in the desired manner. Members of an organization must be clearly informed of the requirements of such promotions to reduce ambiguity on what is expected of them. Furthermore, HR must develop sufficient opportunities for members with the ambition to take initiative in newly developed programs."
export const para8 = "In light of the evolving nature of work and tasks as data analytics and artificial intelligence become more prominent, intuitively, we can expect to see the corresponding evolvement in pay and rewards structures. In a similar article, “AI Is Changing Work — and Leaders Need to Adapt” by Martin Fleming. There is research revealing that jobs requiring industry knowledge have seen an increase in salaries of about $10, 000 over the past 10 years while manufacturing and production jobs saw a decrease of $5, 000 over the same period. This is compelling evidence that jobs that Artificial Intelligence can replace are decreasing in value while their opposite are increasing in value."
export const subheader4 = "Summary"
export const para9 = "Tying together the importance of data analytics to the types of jobs with value, we can arrive at the conclusion that pay structures can and should be used to segment the type of work performed in the industry. This explicit segmentation will continue motivating employees to work towards a data-driven mindset and eventually culture. Taking a look at CEO compensation, with the user of data to make decisions rather than ‘gut-feeling’ or experience, better decisions will be made. Logically speaking a series of excellent decisions by a CEO will lead to better performance and thus a better bottom line used to compensate CEOs and other members of the organization."
export const para10 = "In conclusion, the article by Thomas H. Davenport and Nitin Mittal does an excellent job explaining the importance of data analytics in organizations and ways to implement solutions. They are well researched and provide compelling evidence on the effectiveness of the solutions proposed. There needs to be a greater initiative internally to effectively facilitate the paradigm shift that will give firms an advantage in their industry to achieve sustainable growth."
